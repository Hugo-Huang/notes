Most people procrastinate from time to time. And most of the time it's
not so harmful: putting off doing the laundry for a few days or 15
minutes here and there, lost in Facebook.



But procrastination can also create huge problems for many people — at
work, at school, and at home. Consider all the people who keep meaning
to start \ `saving for
retirement <http://www.vox.com/2014/7/31/5882885/retirement-planning-saving-how-much-do-i-need>`__,
for example, but never do it. Or people with
`obesity <http://www.vox.com/2014/11/17/7230641/maps-charts-obesity-weightloss>`__
or
`diabetes <http://www.vox.com/2014/6/10/5797264/diabetes-is-on-the-rise>`__
who constantly tell themselves: "I'll start eating right tomorrow" — but
never do it. Roughly 5 percent of the population has such a problem with
chronic procrastination that it seriously affects their lives.



None of it seems logical. How can people have such good intentions and
yet be so totally unable to follow through? Conventional wisdom has long
suggested that procrastination is all about poor time management and
willpower. But more recently, psychologists have been discovering that
it may have more to do with how our brains and emotions work.



“procrastinatORS are less compassionate toward themselves”



Procrastination, they've realized, appears to be a coping mechanism.
When people procrastinate, they're avoiding emotionally unpleasant tasks
and instead doing something that provides a temporary mood boost. The
procrastination itself then causes shame and guilt — which in turn leads
people to procrastinate even further, creating a vicious cycle.



But getting a better understanding of why our brains are so prone to
procrastination might let us find new strategies to avoid it. For
example, psychologist Tim Pychyl has co-authored a
`paper <http://postcog.ucd.ie/files/2010%20I%20forgive%20myself,%20now%20I%20can%20study%20How%20self-forgiveness%20for%20procrastinating%20can%20reduce%20future%20procrastination.pdf>`__
showing that students who forgave themselves for procrastinating on a
previous exam were actually less likely to procrastinate on their next
test. He and others have also found that people prone to procrastination
are, overall, less compassionate toward themselves — an insight that
points to ways to help.



`Pychyl <http://http-server.carleton.ca/~tpychyl/prg/about/about_director.html>`__,
a professor at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, has been studying
procrastinators for some 19 years. I talked to him about why people
procrastinate and how they can learn to stop:



**Susannah Locke: What are the biggest misconceptions about
procrastination?**



Tim Pychyl: When a procrastinator thinks about themselves, they’ll
think, "Oh, I have a time management problem" or "I just can’t make
myself do it. There’s a problem with my willpower." And when other
people think about procrastinators, they use that pejorative term:
"They’re lazy."



“"psychologists see procrastination as a misplaced coping mechanism"”



But psychologists see procrastination as a misplaced coping mechanism,
as an emotion-focused coping strategy. [People who procrastinate are]
using avoidance to cope with emotions, and many of them are
non-conscious emotions. So we see it as giving in to feel good. And it’s
related to a lack of self-regulation skills.



I can simplify that and say that psychologists recognize we all have a
six-year-old running the ship. And the six-year-old is saying, "I don't
want to! I don't feel like it!"



**SL: What are you discovering about how procrastinators' brains work?**





TP: Recently we’ve been doing research that relates to the work on
"present self"/"future self" because what’s happening with
procrastination is that "present self" is always trumping "future self."



`Hal
Hershfield <http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/marketing/faculty/hershfield>`__
has done some really great research on looking at how we think
about \ `"future
self." <http://nautil.us/issue/9/time/why-we-procrastinate>`__ He’s
shown that in experimental settings, if someone sees their own picture
digitally aged, they’re more likely to allocate funds to retirement.
When [the researchers] did the fMRI studies, they found our brain
processes present self and future self differently. We think of future
self more like a stranger.



“"if someone sees their own picture digitally aged, they’re more likely
to allocate funds to retirement"”



My graduate student \ `Eve-Marie
Blouin-Hudon <http://www.spsp.org/members/?id=29450161>`__ just did
three studies, and what she looked at is our ability to imagine the
future self. She measured people’s self-continuity. You’d see circles
representing present self and future self and choose how much to overlap
them. Some people see these selves as completely distinct, and some
people see them totally overlapping. The people who see the present and
future self as more overlapping have more self-continuity and report
less procrastination.



She’s doing a study right now using an imagery intervention. So she’s
going to have students think of an image of themselves at the end of the
term. And the hypothesis is that those students who engage with this
imagery of future self will then procrastinate less. We [think] that
people will make less procrastinatory choices now because they’ll
realize that "It’s me in the future we’re talking about, here. I’m going
to be under the gun."



**SL: What's the most surprising thing to you about procrastination?**



TP: I think the most surprising thing that I’m still grappling with is
that for many people, the experience of procrastination doesn’t match
the definition that most of us are working with: a voluntary delay of an
intended action despite knowing you’re going to be worse off for the
delay.



If you speak to people, they’ll tell you that it doesn’t feel voluntary:
"I feel like I have no control over it." For some people, it feels
totally involuntary, like they can’t help themselves.



**SL: What's your one biggest tip for stopping procrastination?**



TP: One of my pet expressions is "Just get started." And it’s important
you don’t say "Just do it" — that’s overwhelming. But just get started.



Whenever we face a task, we’re not going to feel like doing it. Somehow
adults believe that their motivational state has to match the task at
hand. We say, "I’m not in the mood."



Our motivational state rarely matches the task at hand, so we always
have to use self-regulation skills to bring our focus to it. So at
first, it will be "Ok, I recognize that I don’t feel like it, but I’m
just gonna get started."



**SL: What's the evidence that just beginning a task, even in a very
small way, makes it easier to follow through?**



TP: We know from psychological research by `[Andrew]
Elliot <http://www.psych.rochester.edu/people/elliot_andrew/>`__ and
others that progress on our goals feeds our well-being. So the most
important thing you can do is bootstrap a little progress. Get a little
progress, and that’s going to fuel your well-being and your motivation.



Back in the 1990s, I put pagers on students and paged them [eight times
a day for five days before an academic deadline]. And when they finally
started working on the project, empirically we found that they didn’t
see it as as difficult or as stressful as earlier in the week.



So their perceptions of the task changed. There’s lots of reasons to
think that that’s what happens to us when we get started.



**SL: But what about getting distracted?**



TP: `[Peter] Gollwitzer <http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gollwitzer/>`__ and
his colleagues for years have shown us that implementation intentions
make a huge difference to even deal with things like distractions.



Implementation intentions take the form of "If, then." "If the phone
rings, then I’m not going to answer it." "If my friends call me to say
we’re going out, I’m going to say no." So you’ve already made this
pre-commitment.



You can use implementation intentions to keep yourself focused: "If I’ve
finished this part of the article, then I’m going to immediately turn my
attention to reading the next part."



**SL: Can people really overcome procrastination?**



TP: I guess I’m a living case. When I was an undergraduate, I
procrastinated a lot. And now that I understand procrastination, I just
have no room to wiggle.



Because it’s all about self-deception — you aren’t aware that it’s going
to cost you, but you are. When there’s no more self-deception and you
face yourself, you either shit or get off the pot. You’re either going
to do it, or you’re not going to do it.



“"I guess I’m a living case"”



I really like my life, and I like to make time for the things that are
important to me. [Robert] Pozen, who’s written a book on `extreme
productivity <http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Productivity-Boost-Results-Reduce-ebook/dp/B007HBLNSS>`__,
has the OHIO rule: only handle it once. And I’m like that with email. I
look at that email and say "I can reply to it now, or I can throw it
out," but there’s not much of a middle ground. I’m not going to save it
for a while.



And so if I can deal with it in two minutes — this is `David
Allen <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_%28author%29>`__\ ’s
work —  I deal with it.



I used to procrastinate, and now I don't because I got all these wicked
strategies. And it’s every level: some of it’s behavioral, some of it’s
emotional, some of it’s cognitive. And now my biggest challenge is how
do I teach my kids this. That’s really hard.
