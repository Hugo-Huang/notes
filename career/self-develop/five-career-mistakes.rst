You show up to the office on time, you've never missed a project
deadline, you always refill the coffee pot when you're done—but then a
promotion passes you by. What could you possibly be doing wrong?

Maybe nothing. After all, we don't want to make you paranoid. But, just
for peace of mind, check out this list to see if you're unwittingly
doing anything that could be derailing your full career potential. We
spoke with career experts to find out the five biggest mistakes that
employees make, as well as suggestions on how to fix them.

Handling Upsets Poorly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|five-career-mistakes-02|

If you're an overly motivated worker, dealing with setbacks at the
office—like losing an important account or having your (surely awesome)
ideas passed over in an important meeting—can be daunting. "Most
ambitious, well-educated folks are very hard on themselves; they're
overly perfectionistic," says Glo Harris, an executive coach and
organizational consultant. "So, when they feel they have made a mistake,
or 'failed' in their self opinion, it's both disheartening and
paralyzing."

Disappointments at work can stop you from asking crucial questions or
taking on responsibilities that could potentially move you ahead in your
job. It's unrealistic to believe you'll never make mistakes in a long
career, though, and the ability to recover quickly is what can set you
apart from the pack.

**What to do instead:** Change your mind-set, suggests Harris. "Tell
yourself that taking the risk, whatever the outcome, is success enough,"
she says. Instead of being scared to put yourself out there at work for
fear of failure, set an objective to attempt at least one undertaking a
month that is outside your comfort zone.

For example, suggesting a new avenue of advertising for your company could turn
out to be a flop, or offering to take the lead on pitching a new client might go
awry if the client just won't budge. But, over time, you'll learn how to `move
on from your mistakes

whether that means asking for feedback on a presentation or planning for a
better one next time.

Failing to Self-Promote
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|five-career-mistakes-04|

In most work environments, it's up to you to toot your own horn from time to
time when it comes to a job well done. This is especially important when you've
completed a task worthy of praise and your bosses don't even seem to notice.
"Sometimes [a lack of self-praise] is explained by an employee's belief that
self-promotion is somehow unprofessional," says Todd Dewett, a leadership
development coach and author of "`The Little Black Book of Leadership
<http://www.amazon.com/The-Little-Black-Book-Leadership/dp/0980098203?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&ascsubtag=[type|link[postId|1596535994[asin|0980098203[authorId|494647335>`__."
"Other times it's because a person has wrongly assumed the boss or others are
aware of their good work."

**What to do instead:** Unless your boss comes out and tells you you've done a
good job, don't just assume that she's taken notice. "Most workplaces are highly
competitive," says Dewett. "The more you rise in the ranks, the more
intelligence and experience becomes similar across people." In other words,
leaving your hard work unmentioned allows other similarly qualified coworkers to
swoop in and reap the benefits of a boss who's forced to take notice.

The next time you ask to take on a particularly demanding task at work, assure
your boss that you are up to the job by reminding her of past performances that
went off without a hitch. Dewett suggests saying something like, "Jan, let me
throw my hat in the ring for the Acme account. I'm wrapping the Johnson account
about that time, and those two have a very similar industry focus. I'd love to
make another win with Acme if the team needs me." Keep your self-promotion
targeted and low-key to make it the most effective.

Thinking "Me" Instead of "We"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|five-career-mistakes-05|

Taking an active role in your advancement at work is important. But when you
focus only on your personal success or recognition, you're making your work
about individual goals rather than goals that are good for the overall group.
Think of it this way: Your boss's boss isn't interested in your personal
gain—he's worried about what's best for the company. If your actions appear to
benefit the overall health of the company, you'll be integral to helping them
achieve their bottom line, which in turn will make them more likely to want to
keep you on and promote you.

**What to do instead:** Before taking any action at work, ask yourself
what the benefit will be for the team as a whole, suggests Patti
Johnson, a career and workplace expert and C.E.O. of
`PeopleResults <http://www.people-results.com/>`__.

"One of the worst things you can do is to show up and give the signal that you
have all the answers," she said. "This is a surefire way to keep others out if
you need them to play an active role in your work or idea."

Always position yourself as a team player, someone who is ready and willing to
take on group projects and work side-by-side with others for the betterment of
everyone involved. Johnson suggests using language like, "Here are my ideas on
this. What are you guys thinking?" and "Let's plan to work on this together" to
get the ball rolling.

Not Asking for Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|five-career-mistakes-06|

Most workers go through some form of annual employee evaluation, but you should
be getting feedback more than once a year. "In most organizations, [formal
evaluations] are not terribly valuable for the boss or the employee," says
Dewett. "The typical boss, even at many larger firms, is not trained to deliver
an evaluation effectively... without training, they can just be exercises in
unintentionally creating stress." Evaluations also tend to put unnecessary focus
on recent events or very large projects, leaving a great deal of your overall
performance forgotten or unmentioned.

**What to do instead:** In order to become successful, it's important to
evaluate your efforts frequently, and to analyze what works and what doesn't.
"The most successful people know this and go beyond mere compliance to actively
find one or two honest and forthright colleagues who will give them useful,
constructive criticism," says Dewett. "This type of occasional feedback-seeking
behavior is one of the hallmarks of top professionals."

Once you find the colleagues you feel comfortable talking with, Dewett suggests
starting simple. "Ask them what one thing you can do to become a better version
of yourself at work over the next year," he suggests. "You can make it even
easier on them by not asking them to answer immediately. If they are willing to
help, tell them to think about it and drop by later when they have a minute to
share their ideas."

Declining to Take on New Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|five-career-mistakes-07|

Just doing what you were hired to do and nothing more is a big no-no. "If all
you do is what is listed in your job description, it's impossible to get ahead,"
says Dan Schawbel, author of "`Promote Yourself: The New Rules for Career
Success
<http://www.amazon.com/Promote-Yourself-Rules-Career-Success/dp/1250044553?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&ascsubtag=[type|link[postId|1596535994[asin|1250044553[authorId|494647335>`__."
Consider your workplace an even playing field. Everyone there has the same
qualifications, the same hardworking attitude and the same attention to detail.
`Stepping out of your comfort zone
<http://lifehacker.com/the-science-of-breaking-out-of-your-comfort-zone-and-w-656426705>`__
could be just the push your boss needs to give you that promotion instead of
your cube mate.

<http://lifehacker.com/the-science-of-breaking-out-of-your-comfort-zone-and-w-656426705>`__

**What to do instead:** Rather than focusing on the typical tasks for someone in
your position, ask yourself what accomplishments you'll need to have under your
belt before you can score that big promotion. "In order to justify salary
increases and promotions, you have to think outside your job description and
take on additional responsibilities," says Schawbel. "After you master your
current role, ask your manager for additional projects that are more
challenging." At the end of the day, a boss is more likely to take notice of and
promote a person who goes above and beyond the call of duty—not the person who's
happy to stick to the status quo.

But keep in mind that any additional work you take on should help you develop
your skills and lead to other high-level project opportunities; it shouldn't all
be busywork. And don't bite off more than you can chew. Schawbel suggests taking
stock of your current obligations first, and setting a limit for any extra work
you take on based on how much time you estimate you'll need to excel at all of
your tasks.
